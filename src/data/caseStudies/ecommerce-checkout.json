  "challenge": "The e-commerce site had a 68% cart abandonment rate, significantly above industry average. Analytics showed users were dropping off at various points in the checkout process. Users were surprised by shipping costs revealed late, form fields felt overwhelming, mobile experience was poor, and there was no clear progress indication.",

      "Incremental improvements compound — no single change was transformative, but together they drove 25% conversion increase",
      "Transparent pricing upfront eliminated one of the largest abandonment reasons",

      "Data-driven testing was essential — our assumptions about what mattered differed from actual user behavior"

    "intro": "We implemented a streamlined 3-step checkout with clear progress indication, all costs shown upfront, guest checkout option, and optimized mobile experience. Smart defaults and autofill reduced form friction while maintaining necessary information collection.",
